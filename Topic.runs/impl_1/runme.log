WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net encoder_decoder0/idx[7]_i_3_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin encoder_decoder0/idx[7]_i_3/O, cell encoder_decoder0/idx[7]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
