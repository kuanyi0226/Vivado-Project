PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net encoder_decoder0/idx[7]_i_3_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin encoder_decoder0/idx[7]_i_3/O, cell encoder_decoder0/idx[7]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
